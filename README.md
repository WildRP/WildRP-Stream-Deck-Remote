# WildRP Remote for Stream Deck

This plugin lets you connect to your Stream Deck to do a few cool things:

- Send any text command directly to your WildRP client - for example, set a button to send `/me smells like cheese`.
- Send one of up to five randomly chosen commands from a list you provide (so you can pick randomly between a few different emotes, for example)
- Put most of your HUD info on your Stream Deck - set a key to display your health, stamina, voice range, etc.
- Display your compass on a Stream Deck button

You can use this with `e [emote]` to perform an emote, `pvp` to toggle pvp, etc - anything you can do as a text command, can be done with this plugin.
