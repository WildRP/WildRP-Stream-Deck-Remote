# WildRP Remote for Stream Deck

This plugin allows you to run commands (like `/me`, `/pvp`, etc.) on WildRP without using the in-game chat box.

See the [Stream Deck SDK](https://github.com/elgatosf/streamdeck) GitHub.

Requires Node.js v20.5.1+.

# Usage

Run `npm run build` to build the plugin, or `npm run watch` to make it automatically hot-reload while you're working on it.
